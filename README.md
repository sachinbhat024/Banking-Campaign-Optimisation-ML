We address
marketing difficulties faced by the Great Ocean Bank Australia (a fictitious bank), intending to improve their sales 
campaignsâ€™ effectiveness. 

Through customer data analysis and using machine 
learning models, we identified key predictors of successful sales outcomes. We 
developed and evaluated two predictive models: kNN and Decision Trees. Our 
discoveries revealed that post-pruned DT outperformed kNN, providing higher 
performance results. 

We recommend deploying this DT model because of its 
superior performance and easy interpretation. We also applied k-Means 
clustering to segment the customer base for effective targeted marketing 
strategies. Optimal number of clusters= 3 were determined based on the 
metrics like WCSS, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Silhouette Score enabling more 
targeted and effective marketing efforts. Expected value gains include enhanced campaign 
efficiency and customer experience, great word-of-mouth, improved customer 
acquisition, retention, and revenues.
